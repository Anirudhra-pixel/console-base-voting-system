1. Project Title

Console-Based Voting System

2. Description

The Console-Based Voting System is a Java-based command-line application that simulates a basic electronic voting process.
It allows users to add candidates, cast votes using a unique voter ID, view the total vote count for each candidate, and display the leading candidate.

The system ensures that:

A voter can vote only once

Invalid inputs are handled using exception handling

The voting process is simple, secure, and user-friendly

This project is ideal for learning Java fundamentals, Collections Framework, and exception handling.
3. Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8 or higher)

Java Collections Framework

HashMap

HashSet

4. Features

Add candidates dynamically at runtime

Cast votes using a unique voter ID

Prevents duplicate voting

Displays vote count for all candidates

 5. Future Enhancements

Implement admin login authentication

Store voting data using file handling or database (JDBC)

Add voter authentication and verification

Display complete election result statistics

Convert the application into a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX

Develop a web-based version of the voting system

Scanner class for input handling
